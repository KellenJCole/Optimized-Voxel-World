A voxel engine featuring  
-Procedural generation  
-Player collisions and physics  
-Greedy meshing  
-Block placing/breaking  
-Infinite terrain  
-Basic lighting  
-View frustum culling   
-Level of detail    
-Vertex pooling
  
Focus is on optimizing memory usage and speed of generating, meshing, and rendering chunks before moving on to real gameplay elements.  
Once I feel performance is efficient enough, and bug-free, I will move on to interesting procedural generation.
