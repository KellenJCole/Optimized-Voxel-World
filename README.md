The purpose of this project is to created a well-optimized voxel world similar to that of Minecraft 
and eventually add gameplay including basic physics and collision detection, voxel breaking and placement,
saving, item collection, inventory and basic crafting, etc. The program tackles the immense operation of loading
and unloading new chunks on a separate thread and only renders them once they are prepared in order to provide
a seamless exploration.
